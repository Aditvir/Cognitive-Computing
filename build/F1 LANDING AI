WRITEUP DESCRIBING THE PROJECT :

This project is a classification model built using the Landing AI platform, focused on identifying F1 teams based on car images. 
It uses labeled images of F1 cars from 10 different teams, where each image represents a specific team. The model is trained to 
analyze the visual features of the cars and accurately predict the corresponding team. When given a new image, it correctly 
classifies the car by its team based on its appearance. This showcases the potential of image-based classification in 
motorsports analytics.
